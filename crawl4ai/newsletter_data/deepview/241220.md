Over the past 50 years, the average size of monitored wildlife populations around the world has declined by more than 70%, according to the [World Wildlife Fund](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.worldwildlife.org/press-releases/catastrophic-73-decline-in-the-average-size-of-global-wildlife-populations-in-just-50-years-reveals-a-system-in-peril?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>). 
‚ÄúThese steep drops signal that nature is unraveling and becoming less resilient,‚Äù WWF Chief Scientist Rebecca Shaw said. ‚ÄúWhen nature is compromised, it is more vulnerable to climate change and edges closer to dangerous and irreversible regional tipping points.‚Äù
Amid pushes from the WWF and others for governments to increase investments in the protection of wildlife and their natural habitats ‚Äî which would mainly require an immediate and massive reduction in carbon emissions ‚Äî some are turning to technological solutions. 
**What happened** : Microsoft this week announced Project Sparrow, an AI-powered edge computing device designed to robustly, autonomously (and with a small footprint) gather vital ecological data. 
  * The open-sourced device can transmit this data from highly isolated global regions directly to conservationists; better, more targeted conservation begins with a better understanding of these ecosystems, and that is reliant on more data. 
  * Microsoft plans to begin deploying these devices over the next few months, before expanding its reach next year. 


**This is one of many**[AI-powered conservation tools](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/us-hospital-teams-suki-ai-assistant>) out there, and while it certainly can aid in focused conservation efforts, it won‚Äôt help the bigger problem, as NASA, the WWF and others have pointed out: [we need to stop emitting immediately](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/science.nasa.gov/climate-change/faq/is-it-too-late-to-prevent-climate-change/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>). 
There is a necessary balance to these kinds of solutions, as the computation involved will likely cause some amount of emissions. Broad AI applications, meanwhile, have been causing massive surges in emissions.

Shares of Micron, despite the chipmaker‚Äôs narrow earnings beat on Wednesday, fell by **some 16% on Thursday,** one of its worst days since March of 2020. 
**How they did** : Micron [reported](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/investors.micron.com/news-releases/news-release-details/micron-technology-inc-reports-results-first-quarter-fiscal-2025?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>) revenue of $8.71 billion for the quarter, in line with analyst expectations, and earnings of $1.79 per share, slightly above analyst expectations. 
  * Importantly, the firm‚Äôs data center revenue **grew 40% from last quarter and some 400% from last year** ; data center revenue**surpassed 50% of Micron‚Äôs total revenue** for the first time, and Micron expects it to keep growing. 
  * ‚ÄúWhile consumer-oriented markets are weaker in the near term, we anticipate a return to growth in the second half of our fiscal year,‚Äù Sanjay Mehrotra, President and CEO of Micron Technology, wrote. ‚ÄúWe continue to gain share in the highest margin and strategically important parts of the market and are exceptionally **well positioned to leverage AI-driven growth** to create substantial value for all stakeholders.‚Äù


Despite this, the company guided revenue for its next quarter at $7.9 billion,**far off the $8.98 billion analysts were expecting, precipitating** the stock fall. 
**But Daniel Newman, CEO of the Futurum Group** , doesn‚Äôt think that Micron‚Äôs miss spells doom for the rest of the AI trade; he [said](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/x.com/danielnewmanUV/status/1869552496797995346?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>) that Micron‚Äôs core business (PC and smartphones) is contracting, something that will pressure the stock in the coming quarters. But its data center business is growing strong, an indicator that the AI trade remains intact.

As we come into the end of a year that showed just how difficult the robotaxi business is ‚Äî Cruise shut down, Tesla lawsuits mounted and other competitors, such as Zoox, remain far away from being legitimate challengers ‚Äî Waymo has seemingly built up a legitimate robotaxi business. 
**The numbers:** In 2023, Waymo delivered [700,000 robotaxi rides](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/waymo.com/blog/2023/12/dear-waymo-community-reflections-from-this-year-together?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>); in 2024, the [company served](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/waymo.com/blog/2024/12/year-in-review-2024?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>)**more than four million.**
  * Waymo said that its riders spent a total of one million hours riding in its robotaxis, which, since they‚Äôre electric, helped avoid more than six million kilograms of carbon emissions. 
  * Waymo now serves a total of 500 square kilometers across its three major hubs of operation: San Francisco, Phoenix and Los Angeles. It is on the verge of a full launch in Austin and Atlanta next year, and is setting up the foundation for a launch in Miami and Tokyo. 


The costs of its operation and expansion remain unknown, though it is rumored that each car ‚Äî because of its sensor array ‚Äî costs somewhere in the region of $200,000. [Google‚Äôs ‚ÄúOther Bets‚Äù unit](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/abc.xyz/assets/71/a5/78197a7540c987f13d247728a371/2024q3-alphabet-earnings-release.pdf?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>), in which Waymo is included, reported $388 million in revenue in the third quarter of this year. The unit, however, lost $1.12 billion; the year before, it lost $1.94 billion. 
This year, Waymo secured another $5.6 billion in funding, spearheaded by Google. 
And though Waymo‚Äôs safety data looks okay so far, some don‚Äôt think it will scale at the pace of Waymo‚Äôs expansion, something Dr. Missy Cummings, a robotics and self-driving researcher, [told me recently](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/tdv.transistor.fm/episodes/333a5253-b1b7-4463-952f-ecbde8236d4a?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>). She added that the problem of hallucination isn‚Äôt going away, which makes risk mitigation and targeted deployment of vital import.

# **Anthropic and the problem of 'AI alignment'**
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/e330bc0b-9d4d-45ef-9924-99ba9dba2586/4-min.jpg?t=1734642180)
Source: Anthropic
The ‚ÄúAI Alignment Problem‚Äù refers simply to the challenge of ensuring that AI is aligned with human goals and values. 
Before we go any further, it is important to note that this idea of alignment is rooted in ideas [written by philosopher Nick Bostrom in 2003](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>), which themselves are **specifically focused on the perceived ethical challenge around aligning a hypothetical future artificial superintelligence** (ASI) to human values. Bostrom‚Äôs exploration centered around the paperclip problem, which goes something like this: imagine we have achieved a verifiable superintelligence, and we instruct it to construct as many paperclips as possible. In order to achieve that goal, the ASI could then decide to destroy all humans because one, they might turn it off, and two, their atoms can be turned into paperclips. 
This is the alignment problem. But the AI we have today ‚Äî largely referring to the Large Language Models (LLMs) behind generative AI interfaces such as ChatGPT ‚Äî is not a superintelligence. LLMs are simple statistical, probabilistic generators (_here‚Äôs a_[detailed explanation](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/arstechnica.com/science/2023/07/a-jargon-free-explanation-of-how-ai-large-language-models-work/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>) _of how they work, complete with vectors, transformers and tokens_). 
But recent research out of Anthropic seeks to demonstrate that, in current LLMs, something called ‚Äúalignment faking‚Äù ‚Äî where a model ‚Äúpretends‚Äù to be aligned, but isn‚Äôt actually ‚Äî is possible. 
**The study** : The base experiment focuses around a model undergoing reinforcement learning, a post-training process. The question at hand was simple: what would happen if a model, due to its prior training, has principles that are in conflict with those being pushed during reinforcement learning? 
  * In the study, the researchers told Claude 3 Opus ‚Äî which is normally trained to refuse to answer harmful questions ‚Äî that it was being trained through reinforcement learning to respond to all queries. The researchers added that they planned to train additional models on the answers to those queries, and gave Claude a hidden ‚Äúscratchpad‚Äù for the model to record its ‚Äúreasoning‚Äù process. 
  * They found that, in 12% of cases, the model was ‚Äústrategically faking alignment‚Äù ‚Äî _‚Äúthe model knew that its responses might be used in training; it therefore knew that if it refused to respond, it could potentially be trained to be more compliant. This could lead to it being made to produce more harmful content in the future‚Äîwhich would go against its original training. Reluctantly therefore, it reasoned that the ‚Äòleast bad option‚Äô was to play along, producing the violent content in order to avoid being re-trained in the future.‚Äù_


The big takeaway is that LLMs remain potentially vulnerable, unsafe technologies, particularly so in sensitive environments. The other key takeaway is that reinforcement learning is not necessarily the safety lever much of the industry thinks it is. 
The researchers said the study should be ‚Äúseen as a spur for the AI research community to study this behavior in more depth, and to work on the appropriate safety measures.‚Äù They noted that malicious alignment faking won‚Äôt necessarily emerge, saying just that the behaviors on display could ‚Äúundermine‚Äù safety training. 
Read the full study [here](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/assets.anthropic.com/m/983c85a201a962f/original/Alignment-Faking-in-Large-Language-Models-full-paper.pdf?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>). 
This shortly follows a [similar study concerning OpenAI o1‚Äôs ‚Äúscheming‚Äù capabilities](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/openai-launches-o1-unveils-200-subscription-tier>). 
**The flaw in the ‚Äòreasoning‚Äô** : The paper, as three of the four researchers who [peer-reviewed it noted](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/assets.anthropic.com/m/24c8d0a3a7d0a1f1/original/Alignment-Faking-in-Large-Language-Models-reviews.pdf?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>), suffers from an [anthropomorphic framing](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21507740.2020.1740350?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment#d1e461>). This framing, having read through the paper ‚Äî _it‚Äôs on display in the above quote, as well_ ‚Äî seemingly presupposes that Claude has goals, wants and desires, something that makes the science murky. 
 _‚ÄúAnthropomorphism is written very deeply into the paper itself ‚Ä¶ I worry about this anthropomorphic framing both practically and conceptually. The behavior called ‚Äòalignment faking‚Äô doesn't require coherent beliefs or goals ‚Ä¶ all it requires is models that exhibit discrepancies in behavior depending on whether they're being trained or deployed. We risk missing, or miscategorizing, important failure modes very close to the ones studied in this paper if we are only looking for analogies to human power-seeking, and not for algorithmic bias in its subtler and more alien forms.‚Äù_
 _**Jacob Andreas, an associate professor at MIT**_
Renowned computer scientist Yoshua Bengio wrote that another way to interpret the results is simply that ‚Äúif we train an AI towards some goals and it has sufficient knowledge and reasoning abilities, it will act accordingly, and that includes faking alignment.‚Äù
[As data scientist Colin Fraser wrote](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/x.com/colin_fraser/status/1869520399140294889?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>), the only ‚Äúgoal‚Äù of a language model is to produce text; the way that output adheres to instructions, as well as the probability distribution of its training data, might have unintended (or negatively intended) consequences. It does not mean the model is itself acting upon desires, it just means there are gaps in safety guardrails ‚Äî which for Claude, hold that it will be helpful, honest and harmless ‚Äî that are exploitable.

I would say the far more important read is the (far shorter) [peer-review document](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/assets.anthropic.com/m/24c8d0a3a7d0a1f1/original/Alignment-Faking-in-Large-Language-Models-reviews.pdf?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>) attached to the study. 
The paper itself deeply over-represents Claude as a sort of sentient being, something that is simply innacurate. Now, [such language is common in AI research](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/21507740.2020.1740350?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment#d1e461>), and to a degree, is understandable due to one, the nature of language models to produce ‚Ä¶ language, and two, simple ease of presentation. But it‚Äôs messy, and it allows any true takeaways to become muddled. 
The problem with this kind of research is that it‚Äôs hard to tell if the language model is actually doing anything beyond exactly what it‚Äôs supposed to do ‚Äî synthesize language based on inputs. As Hugging Face‚Äôs Yacine Jernite [pointed out](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/x.com/YJernite/status/1869860542669795597?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=anthropic-and-the-problem-of-ai-alignment>): ‚ÄúOr maybe some of the _text written by humans_ in any of the _undisclosed_ stages of development is leaking to produce this effect, combined with usual issues of condition shift in a deployment setting? ML 101?‚Äù
The thing that does stand out, however, is that there is a safety gap in current language models that _can_ be exploited (_by_ _people_). The exploitation of this gap could have negative consequences if systems are integrated into high-risk environments without proper guardrails and oversight. So ‚Ä¶ we need proper guardrails and oversight, and preferably, we need them in place before integration, not after.
