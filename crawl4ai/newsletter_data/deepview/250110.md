**Good morning.**
Before we get into it, if you’re out in LA right now, I hope you and your families are staying safe. You can find some fire department resources [here](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/lafd.org/news/palisades-fire-0?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>). 
Today, we’re getting into the money behind AI. The numbers for 2024 are astronomical, whether you’re looking at capital expenditures, stock surges or VC investments. 
And all the trends are seemingly angled up for 2025.

# **The 2024 tech surge**

A consistent undercurrent to the AI story — riding somewhere beneath regular announcements of new models and new capabilities and sci-fi visions of a fully autonomous future — involves a vast investment landscape. 
These models are costly to the point of being cost-prohibitive, for almost anyone who lacks pockets the size of those wielded by Big Tech and venture capitalists around the world. 
And surrounding that landscape is a combination of blind excitement, tempered excitement, caution and blistering criticism. 
There are two sides to this story. The first involves the public market and Wall Street — the ways in which AI-exposed stocks have performed, and the impression of the analysts that study them. 
And despite rising costs, surging capital expenditures and little revenue to show for it, the AI names have spent the past year riding a wave of investor excitement to truly record-breaking heights. 
## **The AI Boom**
In 2024, as with 2023, powerful, ceaseless stock surges from the tech sector continued to lift markets ever higher. The tech-heavy **Nasdaq finished the year up 29%** ; the **S &P 500 was up 23%** (_after a 24% surge the year before_) and the **Dow Jones Industrial Average was up around 13%**. This push was led by a handful of tech stocks, most of which have clear exposure to artificial intelligence. 
Here, I’m talking about Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon, TSMC and Tesla.
(Tesla is a bit of a weird case — its late-year surge seems tied to President-elect Donald Trump’s win in November, more than the company’s AI or electric vehicle business, but still, the **stock spiked more than 60% in ‘24,** following a year in which it _spiked more than 100%)._
**A look back at related stories we’ve done in the past year:**
  * [Interview: The mismatch of the AI bubble](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/interview-the-mismatch-of-the-ai-bubble>)
  * [The math behind the AI bubble](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/the-math-behind-the-ai-bubble>)
  * [Goldman Sachs publishes blistering report on the AI bubble](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/goldman-sachs-publishes-blistering-report-on-ai-bubble#true-price-of-ai>)


## **How high did they fly?**
Nvidia, the maker of those (insanely) expensive “picks and shovels” for the AI race — the GPU chips vital to the training and operation of AI models — **surged some 171% in 2024** (_following a 240% spike the year before_). On Dec. 30, 2023, Nvidia’s market cap was $1.22 trillion; a year later, the company was valued at around $3.5 trillion. 
  * Shares of Microsoft, following a late-December retreat, spiked some 13% as its **valuation soared from $2.79 trillion last year to $3.1 trillion this year**. **Shares of Amazon spiked 50%** ; its market cap jumped from **$1.5 trillion at the end of 2023 to $2.4 trillion by the end of 2024**. Shares of **Google spiked roughly 37%** ; its **market cap jumped from around $1.6 trillion to $2.3 trillion**. 
  * **Meta, meanwhile, jumped around 70% in 2024;** at the end of 2023, it was valued at around $900 billion. **It is now valued at $1.5 trillion.** And in the span of a year, TSMC went from a $500 billion stock to **a trillion-dollar stock, surging nearly 100%**. 


Though this isn’t comprehensive, just this small handful of companies added hundreds of billions of dollars to their market caps in the past 12 months. 
But the stock surge is almost nothing compared to the capital expenditures this handful of companies has notched. 
## **But at what cost?**
Just Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and Google were [expected to collectively spend](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/business-spending-on-ai-jumps-500-to-13-8-billion-on-200-billion-in-capex>)**around $240 billion in capex** — all largely going to AI — by the end of 2024, a significant increase over last year’s numbers, according to Forbes. All of these firms have spent the past year assuring investors that their [capital expenditures ](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/08/big-tech-capex-spending-is-set-to-soar-once-again/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>)_[will increase in 2025](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.fool.com/investing/2024/11/08/big-tech-capex-spending-is-set-to-soar-once-again/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>)_ as they work to build out AI infrastructure. 
And, while some have been quick to suggest that they are starting to see a bit of revenue from all of these massive expenditures, many of the big players here have made clear that **the AI game is a long one.**
Microsoft CFO Amy Hood said in August that its current investments in AI infrastructure will support the monetization of AI **“over the next 15 years and beyond.”** _Microsoft_ _[plans](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2025/01/03/the-golden-opportunity-for-american-ai/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>)_ _to spend some $80 billion on AI infrastructure in 2025 alone._
Meta CFO Susan Li similarly expects “returns from generative AI to come in over a longer period of time,” adding: “we don’t expect our GenAI products to be a **meaningful driver of revenue in ’24.** But we do expect that they’re going to open up new revenue opportunities over time that will enable us to generate a solid return off of our investment.”
And in the midst of this, some sectors of Wall Street have been losing patience.
D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria told [CNN](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.cnn.com/2024/08/02/tech/wall-street-asks-big-tech-will-ai-ever-make-money/index.html?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>) in August: “if you’re going to invest now and get returns in 10 to 15 years, that’s a venture investment, that’s not a public company investment. For public companies, we expect to get return on investment in much shorter time frames. So that’s causing discomfort, because we’re not seeing the types of applications and revenue from applications that we would need to justify anywhere near these investments right now.”
**A look back at related stories we’ve done in the past year:**
  * [AI companies need a lot of money. Investors are still forking it over](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/ai-companies-need-a-lot-of-money-investors-are-still-forking-it-over>)
  * [OpenAI, others dealing with ‘diminishing returns’ in current architecture](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/openai-others-dealing-with-diminishing-returns-in-current-architecture>)
  * [Competition and power consolidation in AI](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/competition-and-power-consolidation-in-ai>)


At around the same time, Goldman Sachs released a report titled: “[GenAI: Too much spend, too little benefit?](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/goldman-sachs-publishes-blistering-report-on-ai-bubble>)” In the report, Jim Covello, Goldman’s head of Global Equity Research, said that, considering the $1 trillion _(+)_ the industry is expected to spend on AI in the next few years, it remains unclear **what trillion-dollar problem AI will solve.**
“Replacing low-wage jobs with tremendously costly technology is basically the polar opposite of the prior technology transitions I’ve witnessed in my thirty years of closely following the tech industry,” he said, adding that, where the internet provided a low-cost solution to a high-cost problem, GenAI offers a high-cost solution to a low-cost problem. 
That high cost has thus far been eaten by the developers as a means of bringing people on board. And that brings us to the startups.
  * OpenAI, still the dominant developer in the generative AI race, **reportedly**[**lost**](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.cnbc.com/2024/09/27/openai-sees-5-billion-loss-this-year-on-3point7-billion-in-revenue.html?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>)**$5 billion in 2024**. And that’s after it raked in $3.7 billion in revenue. And it expects these losses to keep on mounting. 
  * The Information reported in October that, according to internal documents, OpenAI [expects to spend some ](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/openai-s-long-costly-road-to-profitability>)[$200 billion between 2023 and 2030](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/openai-s-long-costly-road-to-profitability>)[;](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/openai-s-long-costly-road-to-profitability>) more than two-thirds of that amount is expected to go toward the training and deployment of its generative AI models. The startup expects to**lose $44 billion between 2023 and 2028,** saying that it expects to turn a $14 billion profit in 2029. 


Last year, it [raised $6.6 billion in funding](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/ai-companies-need-a-lot-of-money-investors-are-still-forking-it-over>) at a $157 billion valuation; at the same time, it secured a $4 billion revolving line of credit. [It’s not just OpenAI, either](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/meta-and-big-tech-s-nuclear-revolution>); xAI, through a Series B and C funding round both conducted in 2024, **raised a total of around $12 billion** for the year and **Anthropic raked in an additional $4 billion from Amazon**. The costs are almost incomprehensible, but a combination of Big Tech backers and venture capitalists are still interested in footing the bill. 
**And that brings us to** the private markets and the venture capitalists, and it tells a story that is both different and the same from the trends on Wall Street. 
In 2023, according to Crunchbase data, the AI sector raised $55.5 billion.
**In 2024, the sector raised $99.6 billion** , an 80% year-over-year increase. Around a third of that amount went to foundation model companies (largely, in billion-dollar raises). The remaining amount went to sectors seeking to drive an AI impact.
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/25d5cea2-c012-4f1c-b768-92f791203003/Screenshot_2025-01-03_at_11.10.46_AM.png?t=1735920717)
The data here is pretty clear; VCs don’t care about high expenditures, low revenue and uncertain time horizons. They — even the skeptical ones — believe in artificial intelligence. 
Sequoia’s David Cahn [wrote last year](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/the-math-behind-the-ai-bubble>) that there was — at the time — a $600 billion gap in the AI industry, meaning simply that, considering the magnitude of the cost of development, the sector would need to bring in $600 billion in revenue — annually — to _just meet the scope of cost._
**Still, he believes in the potential of AI**. “In reality, the road ahead is going to be a long one. It will have ups and downs. But almost certainly it will be worthwhile.”
**As Pitchbook wrote in an August report** : “Valuations have ramped up, and despite high prices, VCs have consistently been willing to invest.”
So, Despite Goldman’s skepticism — and despite Wall Street’s feelings toward the high costs and long time horizon of generative AI — the stocks have inched ever higher, enterprise adoption of the technology is certainly growing, the costs of development are spiking, the private valuations are increasing and the VCs remain undeterred, all of which makes for a rather complicated picture.
**But, with adoption rates starting to increase, some investors are feeling good about 2025.**
**Wedbush’s Dan Ives, for one** , is super excited about what 2025 might hold for tech and AI. He expects tech stocks to soar another 25% in 2025 “based on underlying strength from the AI Revolution and the 2nd/3rd derivatives of this tidal wave of tech spending and AI cap-ex.”
  * Ives wrote that the $4 trillion market cap club will get “its first three members. We believe the first member of the $4 trillion market cap club will be Apple as the iPhone 16 brings the AI Revolution to Cupertino. In 2025 we also firmly expect both Nvidia and Microsoft to follow Apple in joining the exclusive $4 trillion market cap club as the AI Revolution takes hold into its next gear of growth.”
  * “We expect many enterprises and governments to aggressively head down the AI path with our view that **AI cap-ex budgets will exceed $1 trillion** and catalyze the next wave of use case and software buildouts across the consumer and enterprise landscape.”


**JPMorgan**[**wrote**](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/am.jpmorgan.com/gb/en/asset-management/institutional/insights/market-insights/investment-outlook/ai-investment/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>)**in November** that it expects 2025 to see a broadening out of the market, rather than a bursting of the bubble. 
  * “The valuation gap between the biggest stocks (the megacaps) and the rest is unlikely to persist indefinitely. If the broad AI ecosystem generates sufficient revenues to justify the earnings expectations _already assumed for a handful of companies_ , **the ‘rest’ should catch up over time,”** according to JPM. “If instead, the broader corporate universe does not see the clear use case of these technologies and are unwilling to pay for them, **then a ‘catch down’ scenario is more likely.”**
  * “The strong fundamentals of the megacaps, both relative to other parts of the S&P 500 today, as well as relative to the 2000 tech bubble, provide some comfort that **a major ‘catch down’ is unlikely,”** according to JMP.


Still, the firm noted that the gap between revenue expectations, capital expenditures and actual revenue growth **will come into sharper focus next year, with investors saying:****“show me the money.”**
“If the developers and the integrators can’t generate sufficient profit,**this weakness will eventually spread up the value chain,”** JPM wrote. “In our view the gap between the valuation of mega-cap tech and the broader S&P 500 is unsustainable. However, unlike 2000, **we see a ‘catch up’ scenario as more likely** than a ‘catch down’ scenario.”
**[Sequoia expects](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.sequoiacap.com/article/ai-in-2025/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>)****the question of investment returns** on AI spend to remain a problem in 2025, but also expects Big Tech capital expenditures to begin to stabilize. 
  * “Going into 2024, the Big Tech companies were nervous about AI being a threat to their oligopoly in the cloud business. Entering 2025, the picture has changed dramatically,” Sequoia wrote. “**Big Tech companies have their arms locked firmly around the AI revolution.** Not only do they control the vast majority of the data centers that power AI, but they own significant equity stakes in the big model companies, and they are among the largest backers of new AI startups.”
  * “With Big Tech feeling more confident, we think 2025 will be a stabilization year for AI CapEx. If 2024 was a scramble to sign deals for land and power,**2025 will be an execution year.** Shovels are in the ground, and these companies will be focused on completing their new projects on-time and on-budget. They will then need to sell this installed capacity to customers and work with enterprises to help them achieve success with their new AI capabilities.”

**Deepwater Asset Management**[**believes**](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/deepwatermgmt.com/deepwaters-2025-predictions/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>)**,** as it has said in the past, that we are in the second year of a 3-5 year AI-driven bull market **“that will end in the bursting of a bubble.”** Deepwater expects the Nasdaq to experience two 10% pullbacks in 2025, though it will still finish the year higher than it started. 
**Gené Teare, a senior data editor at Crunchbase** , expects “funding proportions to AI to **increase in 2025.** While foundation model companies might not raise as much as they did in 2024, AI infrastructure and applications will continue to see funding increase across multiple sectors."
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/37cba1f9-38e5-44a5-8eb3-ea3643ea3893/image.png?t=1734644403)
OK, let’s talk about [reversion to the mean](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.investopedia.com/terms/m/meanreversion.asp?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>). 
It’s a financial theory that the price of an asset will eventually revert to its long-term average value; nothing rises forever, nothing falls forever. The hard part here is obviously figuring out the timing of such reversions. 
If you look at **historical sector weightings of the S &P 500,** tech has been on the rise in recent years. In 2024 it[**came in at 32.9%**](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.investopedia.com/best-25-sp500-stocks-8550793?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>) and in 2023 it was roughly 28.1%; things have been high and climbing since 2020 or so. 
Before the 2020 cycle, **the last time the weighting of the tech sector exceeded 28% was in 1999** , _during the peak of the dot-com bubble._
The average weighting of the tech sector of the S&P 500 — according to [data from Bespoke Investing Group](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2023/07/070323-Sector-Weights-5037189urijef.pdf?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends>) — between **1990 and 2023 is 17.5%.** According to a [slightly different dataset,](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/einvestingforbeginners.com/historical-sp-500-industry-weights-20-years/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-investing-trends#historical>) between 2002 and 2023, the average **weighting is 16.68%**. 
So, let’s split the difference and say that the average weighting of the S&P’s tech sector is 17%. **It is currently nearly double that average**. I see no reason why mean reversion will not kick in at some point here — this is what JPMorgan was talking about with their catch-up or catch-down scenarios. One of two things will happen; either the rest of the stocks will catch up and things will level out, or the tech stocks will fall to meet their non-tech peers. I think we’ll see a bit of both, and I think the catch-down might well begin in 2025 as investor impatience persists. 
At the same time, AI has been consuming an enormous amount of venture funding, a reality that just won’t continue forever. And, according to the VCs I’ve connected with, investing in AI has grown more challenging. Excitement might be far from dampened, but the landscape is becoming more expensive and more complex to invest in; I think the VC trends will start to falter next year, as well. 
We are pretty clearly in a bubble. Bubbles do two things; they expand, and they expand, and they expand … and then they burst. Again, nothing goes up forever. If the bubble swells another 20% next year, it would be approaching a danger point. 
I don’t know what the burst will look like — _the dot-com burst didn’t kill the internet, it just killed off a bunch of internet companies_ — but I am sure that it is coming, and probably coming soon. 
To make this trackable, I’ll say we’ll see the beginnings of a burst by the end of 2025, marking 2026 as the year the AI bubble comes apart. A lot of companies will fall, leaving the Big Tech giants in a clear field. When this happens, Nvidia will have a very tough go of things.

# 💭 A poll before you go
Thanks for reading today’s edition of The Deep View! 
We’ll see you in the next one. 
### Here’s your view on AI progress: 
45% are in the middle; 16% think robotaxis will become normal in 2025 and 18% think OpenAI will achieve a (meaningless) AGI in 2025.
**Middle:**
  * “If you follow or look into cognition-based science, you can see there is an extreme gulf between human and machine. LLMs and the present range of AI are nowhere near approaching the capabilities of the human mind. If you remember back to the AI shown in 2001: A Space Odyssey, you would have seen/heard the good doctor teaching the computer. Until we are at a point we can teach the AI, like we teach children, I suspect we have little to fear.”

**Good morning, and welcome to part 3 of our special edition series.**
In 2023, Waymo [delivered](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/waymo.com/blog/2023/12/dear-waymo-community-reflections-from-this-year-together?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-robots-avs-and-technical-advancements>) more than 700,000 trips. 
In 2024, the self-driving firm delivered more than four million rides. 
The past 12 months saw a lot of improvements in autonomous vehicles, robotics and the AI models that make them possible. But it also affirmed certain limitations, which grounds the technology in a rather interesting way. 
Let’s get into it.

# **The rise of Waymo**
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/6d8b2e49-53c7-4340-b06d-418f69a7b6dc/2.jpg?t=1734452638)
Source: Waymo
By the end of 2024, [Waymo had expanded its operations](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/the-public-health-crisis-of-ai>) to serve a total of 500 square kilometers across its three major hubs: San Francisco, Los Angeles and Phoenix. And with those arenas on lock, the self-driving firm spent the year laying the foundation for an expansion into Austin, Atlanta, Miami and Tokyo set to take place in 2025. 
If you measure the rate of self-driving progress by Waymo alone, the company, at this point, has arguably established an operable robotaxi business. 
But scale, even for Waymo, remains a challenge at two different levels.
The first, of course, is cost. Waymo’s financials aren’t clear — parent company Google records Waymo’s numbers beneath its “Other Bets” umbrella, which disguises the full scope of Waymo’s revenue and losses. But, going just by the unit itself, the [loss seems to be narrowing](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/the-public-health-crisis-of-ai>); in the third quarter of 2024, the “Other Bets” unit reported $388 million in revenue and a $1.12 billion loss, a far smaller loss than the $1.98 billion reported the year before. 
The cost of each vehicle, meanwhile, is rumored to be somewhere in the region of $200,000.
All in, you certainly have a loss-making business. But the days of robotaxi revenues being perpetually on the horizon are over, at least for Waymo; the firm might well continue losing money for years, but it is finally generating a return. And investors seem sold on its potential; Waymo in 2024 closed a $5.6 billion funding round, led, unsurprisingly, by Google. 
You might call 2024 the year that Waymo pulled ahead. 
The other challenge of scale relates to safety. Thus far, Waymo has avoided any severe accidents and lawsuits, though it _is_[being investigated](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.cnn.com/2024/05/14/business/self-driving-cars-waymo-zoox-regulators-investigating/index.html?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-robots-avs-and-technical-advancements>) by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). It remains unclear how many miles are clocked by each vehicle in its fleet, the average distance of each ride and the [role and scope of its remote operators](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/on-self-driving-waymo-is-playing-chess-while-tesla-plays-checkers/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-robots-avs-and-technical-advancements>); the [numbers have yet to scale to a point](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/the-complicated-statistics-behind-safe-self-driving-cars>) where they can support sweeping safety comparison against humans, and self-driving researchers remain skeptical that Waymo’s safety record will scale in kind with its expansion. 
# Sinking the competition
Now, those two issues of cost and safety have proved too much to overcome for other players in the robotaxi race. Cruise — until the end of 2023, Waymo’s most prominent competitor — was forced in 2023 to shutter its operations after a Cruise robotaxi struck and dragged a pedestrian. The self-driving unit spent 2024 very slowly, very cautiously, making its way back to the road, [only to be dissolved by parent General Motors](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/google-s-gemini-2-0-era-is-here>) due to issues of cost and too much competition. 
GM will be merging Cruise with its internal teams next year to pursue advanced driver-assist tech, rather than straight-up robotaxis. 
Amazon-owned Zoox, meanwhile — the only one making a robotaxi without traditional car controls — is [rolling slowly and](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/zoox.com/journal/zoox-robotaxi-in-san-francisco?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-robots-avs-and-technical-advancements>) steadily. In 2024, the firm began testing its services in San Francisco and expanded its Las Vegas test, with plans to begin welcoming public riders sometime in 2025. 
And that brings us to Tesla, the Elon Musk-owned company that has been steadily rolling out software updates to its misnamed Full-Self Driving software for months. See, Tesla is a bit of a weird case here, especially against a backdrop of robotaxi firms. The company, for years, now, has offered two different driver-assist softwares: Autopilot and Full-Self Driving (FSD). Despite the implications of their names, neither of these offers legitimate self-driving; both require the hands-on, eyes-on attention of the driver. 
This conflict between Tesla’s marketing and the realities of its software is at the root of more than a dozen lawsuits — not counting the multiple federal and state investigations — [that are ongoing against Tesla and Musk](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/character-ai-sued-for-mental-health-decline-in-teenage-users-allegedly-encouraged-user-to-murder-his>). 
NHTSA [warned Tesla](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/character-ai-sued-for-mental-health-decline-in-teenage-users-allegedly-encouraged-user-to-murder-his>) in November to ease up on the self-driving hype in its marketing materials online. 
Musk in [October unveiled Tesla’s own stab at a robotaxi](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/tesla-stock-plummets-following-robotaxi-unveil>), the flashy, two-seater Cybercab, which he said will enter production in 2026. In the meantime, he said that the Model 3 and Y will go fully autonomous in Texas and California next year, though how he’ll conquer the regulatory (and technical) burdens there remains unclear. 
## **Robocars and robo-workers**
But Musk, to his credit, has more than one autonomous basket to draw from. I’m talking about Optimus, his humanoid robot. 
While progress is hard to measure, externally — all we’ve really seen this year is a few videos of the robot walking around — those videos show a big leap in progress compared to 2021, when Musk revealed the Optimus robot, which, at the time, was a man in a suit … 
As of October, the [robot was capable](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/competition-and-power-consolidation-in-ai>) of exploring unseen spaces autonomously, climbing stairs and carrying heavy objects without overheating, according to Tesla. 
But Figure, Tesla’s big humanoid robotics competition, [spent the year demonstrating](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/x.com/figure_robot?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-robots-avs-and-technical-advancements>) its humanoid robots in use at a BMW factory, a step Optimus has yet to take. Earlier in the year, Figure partnered with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to its robotic interfaces, and in February, closed a $675 million funding round at a $2.6 billion valuation. 
Figure plans to develop and deploy [billions of humanoid](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.figure.ai/master-plan?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-robots-avs-and-technical-advancements>) robots to take care of the jobs humans don’t like doing, and, eventually, to explore space. 
Researchers, meanwhile, spent the year working to combine advancements in generative AI and 3D mapping with advanced robotics; the early results, [according to a Johns Hopkins team](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.jhuapl.edu/news/news-releases/240822-human-robot-teaming?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-robots-avs-and-technical-advancements>), are promising. The development of a generative AI “agent” in August enabled a dog-shaped robot to respond to natural language commands and navigate its surroundings. A possible result is a robotic assistant for battlefield medics.
And that brings us right around to the underlying software, the Large Language Models (LLMs) that are making all this possible. 
## **The wall**
We talked earlier this week about agents, which essentially marks a push away from single models and toward model systems. This has been the industry’s attempt to overcome the fundamental limitations of language models, because, for all the releases this year — OpenAI o1/o3, Google’s Gemini 2.0, Llama 3.3, etc. — hallucination (or confabulation) and bias remains a part of the architecture. 
Attempts to achieve reliability in 2024 got more creative. IBM, for instance, is [pushing advances in small language models](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/ibm-and-the-road-to-achieving-ai-efficiency>) intended to be combined with enterprise data, alongside literal “guardian” models to ensure safety and reliability. Contextual AI, which has always been focused on systems, [developed a new observability model.](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>) Enterprise startup Writer is [working on two paradigms](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/smaller-but-deeper-writers-secret-weapon-to-more-powerful-ai>); wider, more general-purpose models, and smaller (but deeper) “reasoning” models. 
And indeed, “reasoning” models have become all the buzz. 
OpenAI’s got o1 (and now, o3, but it’s not clear when it’ll actually be open for use) and Google’s got Gemini 2.0 Flash Thinking, both of which take advantage of chain-of-thought ‘reasoning’ to better answer queries. 
Still, the end of 2024 marked a point where the industry seemed to accept that scale — i.e., increasing the quantity of compute and training data — [is not enough to somehow morph a language model into a more powerful,](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/openai-others-dealing-with-diminishing-returns-in-current-architecture>) less-flawed system. Companies increasingly turned to combinations of synthetic and organic data, focusing on data that is better organized and of higher quality, while others — specifically in the enterprise — went all-in on hyper-specific models, trained on company data and designed to accomplish specific tasks, something that reduces the risk of hallucination. 
[Even the unveiling of OpenAI’s o3 model](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/openai-unveils-powerful-new-model>) acknowledges the fact that scale alone is not enough; though we know little about the system, we do know that the real boost in performance has to do more with its internal Chains of Thought rather than pure scale. 
And even with o3, GPT-5 isn’t here, yet, and doesn’t seem to be on its way. 
A new paradigm remains out of reach; the work, instead, has turned into optimizing the current paradigm. 
And there is likely a long way they can take it. 
But, looking at the benchmarks, the rate of progress has slowed down. The kind of exponential growth notched in early 2023 didn’t really appear in 2024 (o3 might mark a difference here, but nothing about the model has been independently verified by external researchers). Growth has become incremental, but that doesn’t mean growth hasn’t occurred. 
**Dr. John Licato, an associate professor of computer science** at the University of South Florida, told me that “the danger of hallucination is still there. I don’t really feel it’s gotten much better in the past year.”
  * “The fundamental arguments for why hallucination is inevitable are still there … I’m on the side where I’m less and less interested even in the thought of AGI (artificial general intelligence). The definitions are never consistent, even within the people who talk about it. It’s just too inconsistent, not rigorous.”
  * “The way that I’ve seen progress in this space has kind of been … you know when you’re in high school your sports ability doubles, and then you get to Olympic level stuff and their differences are measured in a quarter of a second. It seems that that’s what’s happening. In terms of absolute numbers, the improvements of the past 6 months are lower than the 6 months preceding it, because**that gets it close to the theoretical maximum** … I still see that as a significant increase.”


“I think we also want to be careful to disparage incremental improvements. That’s how science works. Incremental improvements. If you keep trying to pursue the kind of progress where you reinvent the wheel every time, you’re not going to make any progress. When you actually pursue incremental improvements, it’ll look like something dramatic when you reach a checkpoint. Transformers, the rest of the world saw that as a huge leap forward, but it really was an incremental improvement.”
John Licato 
**A look back at related stories we’ve done in the past year:**
  * [Gary Marcus on fighting for a positive AI future](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/gary-marcus-on-fighting-for-a-positive-ai-future>)
  * [Eric Xing and the age of AI empowerment](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/eric-xing-and-the-age-of-ai-empowerment>)
  * [MIT professor on achieving fair AI ](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/mit-professor-on-achieving-fair-ai>)


**Johns Hopkins’ Dr. Bart Paulhamus** said in a recent media briefing that human-robot teaming will have a significant “impact” in 2025, due to the convergence of two technologies: generative AI and robotics. 
  * “The next wave is AI agents, powered by generative AI. And those … will be able to make decisions and take action, and that’s exactly what we want robots to do,” Paulhamus said. 
  * “This agentic AI, and the ability to tap into perception tools and movement tools and grasping tools, but also its ability to understand its environment and take action with that. So I think this is really exciting.” The Johns Hopkins team, plus a number of other research institutions, is focused on embodied AI, bringing the best advancements in generative tech to the physical world. 


**Dr. John Bates, the CEO of SER,** expects new developments — architectures beyond deep learning — to appear in 2025. 
  * "We've been pursuing AI or the concept of it since the 1950s, but what we truly mean by the term today refers to intelligent programs that can reason. We’re not there yet, and philosophers and neuroscientists might argue that we never will be. Currently, everything we're doing revolves around Deep Learning. This involves using artificial neural networks to identify patterns and apply learned rules to navigate specific domains.”
  * “We will almost certainly see new developments emerging — perhaps genetic models, for instance, which operate differently from neural networks or Deep Learning approaches. The key point is that what we currently have is not truly reasoning in any sense; it’s AI trained on data. We’ve defined what good reasoning looks like, and as a result, the AI replicates that behavior.”


“In a sense, none of this is the main concern — what truly matters is whether these technologies help us and prove to be useful. **I believe 2025 will be a pivotal year for a quantum leap in AI, potentially offering humanity not just one or two useful advancements, but a genuine game-changer — perhaps in** fields like medicine or transportation, though we can't say for certain yet,” he said. 
“For me — and perhaps for many others — it would be genuine home robots that can handle tasks like ironing and cleaning the apartment that would be genuinely beneficial,” Bates added. “Achieving this is quite challenging, but perhaps 2025 will be the year we finally see it come to fruition.”

Almost nobody will give you their definition.”
“I am not saying we will never get AGI,” he added. “I am saying that many basic problems haven’t been solved. And I am saying, as every roboticist on the planet knows, that we shouldn’t take demos seriously, until purported products are actually released and subjected to outside scrutiny.”
In April, he wrote a list of things that ordinary people do that he doubts AI will be able to do by the end of 2025. Here are a few of them:
  * Watch a previously unseen mainstream movie and be able to follow plot twists, know when to laugh and be able to summarize it without giving away any spoilers or making up anything that didn’t actually happen.
  * Drive off-road vehicles, without maps, across streams, around obstacles such as fallen trees, and so on.
  * Write engaging biographies and obituaries without obvious hallucinations that aren’t grounded in reliable sources.

Here’s the thing about AGI. I’m coming around to the idea most recently espoused by Sam Altman that we’ll achieve AGI sooner than we expect, and it’ll mean much less than anyone thinks. 
I think this will happen, not because we will crack a hitherto unachievable breakthrough, but because the definition of AGI will become steadily cheapened until it becomes in-reach. 
I take AGI to mean a general intelligence, a system capable of dynamic, flexible reasoning. It doesn’t have to be human-like at all, but it needs to possess a few characteristics that humans possess: flexibility, adaptability and generalization. 
Essentially, my big AGI marker is simple; if someone can develop a — transparent — system, with _very little training data_ , that is able to apply its “knowledge” reliably across novel situations, then I would say we might have a general intelligence on our hands. Because machine learning is machine learning, I do not expect this to happen. In fact, I would be shocked if we see something like this at any point soon; the latest innovations, o3 included, are all focused on leveraging massive quantities of training data. Smaller models tend to perform significantly worse across the so-called reasoning benchmarks that have become so important to the developers, which is an unsurprising result of the probabilistic architecture of machine learning algorithms (more data equals better probabilities). 
Something like this would seem to require models to actually understand their output, which would raise a lot of questions and today seems massively inaccessible. 
So that won’t happen in 2025. 
But through more training data, more compute and Chain of Thought explorations, large-scale models, albeit inefficiently and without consistent reliability, will become increasingly capable of mimicking that understanding, meaning their corpus of training data that enables it will become less and less important to some of the people using these products. 
Brute force is good enough for a lot of folks, and we’ll see a refining of brute force intelligence mimicry next year. Because of that, we won’t be anywhere close to an actual AGI, but if companies begin to measure “AGI” by a definition that looks only at what it is sometimes able to do and ignores _how_ it is able to do so, I wouldn’t be surprised if some actors declare that AGI has been achieved next year. 
This will create an interesting dynamic because research into the tech won’t stop; this is, after all, what the entire field has been pushing toward for decades. 
I do expect to see more grounded advancements in the models that make robotics possible, and I do think that different iterations of AI-enabled robots will become quite popular next year. They will be grounded by frustrating limitations — high cost, high energy use, short battery life, slow motion — but we’ll start to see them deployed in more arenas that remain high-risk or otherwise undesirable to humans. 
And on the self-driving front, Tesla will do what it has always done; sell hype, and fail to deliver. Waymo, meanwhile, will continue its expansion, although I expect that this expansion will falter sometime next year due to an incident (hopefully, a minor one) that seems unavoidable given the scope and speed of the company’s growth, crossed with the ongoing limitations of the architecture. 
I don’t think the hype will thin out next year. I think it will grow. But I expect the architectural limitations — bias, hallucination and compute cost/energy consumption — to persist, something that, in some sectors, might well blunt the excitement around adoption.

# 💭 A poll before you go
Thanks for reading today’s edition of The Deep View! 
We’ll see you in the next one. 
### Here’s your view on the ethics of AI: 
45% of you think the ethical issues related to AI will get worse next year; 21% think, as regulation comes into force, they might start to get better. The rest aren’t sure. 
**Gonna get worse:**
  * _“Even with one party holding the reins in all three branches of government, polarization will make mitigation all but improbable.”_


**Gonna get worse:**
  * _“Ethical companies will behave ethically... however, there are MANY, MANY entities that don't care about ethics and will generate a lot of chaos, so I believe things will get worse, much worse.”_


### What do you think? Will AI advance like crazy in 2025, or will it falter?

Source: Created with AI by The Deep View
At the beginning of 2024, the ethics of generative artificial intelligence came into focus in a major way, centered in a dark spotlight around Taylor Swift; a series of sexually explicit, AI-generated deepfakes of the singer [went viral on social media](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thestreet.com/technology/deepfake-porn-ai-taylor-swift-social-media-lawyer-experts?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>), leading to a weeks-long period in late January and early February where it became hard to avoid a positive flood of explicit, AI-generated photos of a number of female celebrities. 
Eventually, accounts were banned and the photos were removed, but the problem didn’t go away. 
**Deepfake harassment** : This kind of deepfake harassment wasn’t a new phenomenon; it’s been [going on since at least 2017.](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thestreet.com/technology/deepfake-porn-ai-taylor-swift-social-media-lawyer-experts?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>) But, back in that pre-GenAI era, it took bad actors hours or even days to produce just one deepfake image; and even then, it wasn’t all too convincing. 
  * GenAI, on the other hand, allows anyone to very quickly produce highly realistic images, all resulting from short, simple English prompts — the days of having to understand coding languages in order to mess around with these kinds of algorithms are long gone. 
  * The issue quickly escalated beyond Taylor Swift, leading to a deepfake crisis in schools [around the world](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.msn.com/en-us/crime/general/deepfake-crisis-at-schools-crimes-stoke-distrust-fear/ar-AA1v3u5M?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>). This began at the end of 2023 with [students at a New Jersey high school](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thestreet.com/technology/deepfake-porn-ai-taylor-swift-social-media-lawyer-experts?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>) and has [since grown rampant](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thestreet.com/technology/how-one-deepfake-revenge-porn-victim-aims-to-change-the-system?utm_source=www.thedeepview.co&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=current-harms-and-the-real-world-impacts-of-algorithmic-decision-making>). In November, a [Pennsylvania private school was shut down over a deepfake nude scandal,](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/school-failed-to-report-ai-nudes-of-kids-for-months-now-parents-are-suing/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>) with parents filing lawsuits against the administration for not properly responding to the crisis. 


According to recent [research from the nonprofit Internet Matters](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/player.flipsnack.com/?hash=NjY1NkZDQkJEQzkrZGtsdmFzOGNqbA%3D%3D&p=2&utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>), some **13% of teenagers** say they have had experience with explicit deepfake image abuse. 
**A look back at related stories we’ve done in the past year:**
  * [AI cameras were quietly used to detect the emotions of UK passengers](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/ai-cameras-quietly-used-detect-emotions-uk-train-passengers>)

  * [ElevenLabs’ latest release highlights the issue of digital necromancy](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/elevenlabs-latest-release-highlights-the-issue-of-digital-necromancy>)


In the U.S., **there remains no federal legislation** regarding this kind of deepfake abuse. The [Defiance Act,](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3696/text?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>) which would allow victims to sue over the spread of nonconsensual explicit deepfakes, passed the Senate over the summer, but has yet to pass the House. Legislation regarding the matter remains patchwork at best in the states; and while the policymakers debate regulatory approaches, the problem persists, with dozens of websites specifically marketed as AI-powered ‘nudify’ tools**remaining operational.**
The city of San Francisco in August [filed suit against 16 of those websites](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/family-poisoned-after-using-ai-generated-mushroom-hunting-book>). 
# The wider impacts
**But the ethical impacts of deepfakes** stretch far beyond image abuse and into weaponized identity hijacking that has enabled the spread of a truly concerning variety of misinformation. 
  * Even as AI-powered [vocal fraud has become something of a norm](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thestreet.com/technology/how-one-tech-company-is-tackling-recent-proliferation-deepfake-fraud?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>) — _phone calls from AI-generated relatives asking for money, for instance_ — political and election-related fraud and misinformation spread throughout much of last year; this began with a deepfaked robocall of [President Joe Biden that circulated in February,](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thestreet.com/technology/how-the-company-that-traced-fake-biden-robocall-identifies-a-synthetic-voice?utm_source=www.thedeepview.co&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=civai-s-latest-program-can-deepfake-you-in-under-5-seconds>) encouraging New Hampshire voters to not participate in the primary. As the election drew nearer, Elon Musk took to [sharing AI-generated images and videos of Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/how-elon-musk-and-a-kamala-harris-deepfake-ad-sparked-a-debate-about-free-speech-and-parody/ar-BB1r2j6o?utm_source=www.thedeepview.co&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=civai-s-latest-program-can-deepfake-you-in-under-5-seconds>). 
  * Both [Meta](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/about.fb.com/news/2024/12/2024-global-elections-meta-platforms/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>) and [OpenAI](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/deepfakes-spiked-245-year>) have detailed their efforts to shut down covert influence operations that had been attempting to utilize the generative AI products operated by the two companies; looking back at the U.S. election last year, Meta said that it prevented nearly 600,000 requests to generate images of the candidates, [adding that the risks](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/about.fb.com/news/2024/12/2024-global-elections-meta-platforms/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-threats-harms-and-ethics>) of electoral interference from generative AI**“did not materialize in a significant way and that any such impact was modest and limited in scope.”**


**It’s not just election-related information;** AI-generated books, images and articles have spread across the internet, threatening widespread information pollution that has already had dangerous impacts. 
In August, we wrote about a British family who was [poisoned after using](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/family-poisoned-after-using-ai-generated-mushroom-hunting-book>) what turned out to be an AI-generated mushroom hunting guidebook; in the process, I discovered several AI-generated mushroom guidebooks listed on Amazon, [which the company removed](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/amazon-pulls-ai-generated-books-after-deep-view-inquiry>) following my request for comment. 
And, pivoting away from the deepfake side of things, issues of generative AI leading to mass surveillance and algorithmic discrimination have proliferated: a November investigation uncovered [discrimination baked into Denmark’s digitized social welfare program](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/report-mass-surveillance-and-human-rights-violations-in-denmark>); the [steady adoption of AI](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/cops-are-starting-to-use-ai-to-write-their-reports>) into already [discriminatory predictive policing efforts](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/researchers-call-for-the-abolishment-of-carceral-ai>) has continued; and the adoption of generative AI by [hospitals has](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/current-harms-and-the-real-world-impacts-of-algorithmic-decision-making>) continued, leading to many concerned nurses and patients alike. 
**A look back at related stories we’ve done in the past year:**
  * [I downloaded Character AI. It’s profoundly disturbing](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/i-downloaded-character-ai-it-s-profoundly-disturbing>)
  * [Researchers call for the abolishment of ‘carceral’ AI](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/researchers-call-for-the-abolishment-of-carceral-ai>)
  * [US Commission calls for ‘Manhattan Project’ for AGI](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/us-commission-recommends-manhattan-project-for-ai>)


The psychological, sociological impacts of AI companionship, meanwhile, came into sharp focus when a [boy died by suicide after falling in love with a Character AI chatbot.](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/i-downloaded-character-ai-it-s-profoundly-disturbing>) To date, a [second lawsuit has been filed](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/character-ai-sued-for-mental-health-decline-in-teenage-users-allegedly-encouraged-user-to-murder-his>) against the company by the mother of a teenage boy who, she argues, became mentally ill and unstable due to a close relationship with bots on Character. 
And the environmental impacts of increasing investments in generative AI, meanwhile, have steadily pushed much of the [Big Tech sector further from achieving their climate goals](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/the-grid-is-the-most-complicated-machine-ever-built-ai-is-stressing-it-out>), with the bulk of these giants — Meta, Google, Microsoft and Amazon — [pursuing nuclear power specifically to meet their AI energy requirements](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/meta-and-big-tech-s-nuclear-revolution>) _._ But, before the nuclear comes online, AI data centers are taking advantage of fossil fuels, a situation that is leading to spiking emissions and a [burgeoning public health crisis](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/the-public-health-crisis-of-artificial-intelligence>) due to steadily worsening air quality. 
There’s also the general cybersecurity war that’s been taking place, with cybercriminals vastly [empowered by generative AI tools,](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/civais-latest-program-can-deepfake-5-seconds>) which have introduced specificity, speed and scale to their operations. Cybersecurity officials have, meanwhile, adopted [generative AI tools to fight back against ever-increasing attacks](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/report-ai-and-cybersecurity-in-the-enterprise>), even as others work to educate companies and individuals about the [myriad security risks](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/cybersecurity-experts-say-artificial-intelligence-is-an-incredibly-vulnerable-technology#true-price-of-ai>) posed by AI, with AI and because of AI. 
On top of all this, there are ongoing legal battles regarding the legality of training generative AI models on copyrighted material, even as those models are beginning to be used to replace human workers, a challenging dynamic for the job market going forward. 
In sum, 2024 was a busy year of AI proliferation and integration, and the resulting moral and ethical impacts are vast, to say the least. 
The experts I spoke to expect 2025 to be worse. 
**Looking ahead:****Nell Watson, an author and leading AI ethicist,** told me that, with the rise of the increasingly autonomous agentic AI that we talked about yesterday, “ordinary members of the public will be tasked with teaching and managing these systems, something that**remains a major, uncertain challenge even for experts.”**
  * “Beyond alignment issues, agentic AI systems will certainly be employed to target systems and individuals for various kinds of attack, whether its creating designer synthetic data to poison another model (possibly even hijacking it in the process),” she said. “A friendly being must try to learn, model and accommodate the preferences of others. This is another strength of agentic systems, which could learn to surprise and delight us as a good friend might. However, these same capabilities can be used to observe human foibles, to strike at an exploitable weakness at a calculated moment of greatest impact.”
  * “The transition to agentic AI represents both unprecedented opportunity and risk, and this requires an investment in thoughtful governance to harness its potential while mitigating dangers. We must not only ensure that these powerful AI systems are used in an ethical manner, but we must now also work to ensure that these systems remain safe and loyal partners instead of impish and capricious minions.”


**Ajay Amlani, president of iProov, expects deepfake fraud** specifically to become fully weaponized in 2025: “a wave of account takeovers and fraudulent transactions will force banking regulators worldwide to take decisive action. Led by pioneers like Thailand and Vietnam, countries will mandate the implementation of biometric verification for payment authentication,” he said. 
Amlani added that he expects a “deepfake of a Fortune 500 CEO will cause significant disruption in the financial markets.” 
  * “The fabricated video, announcing a false merger, will trigger a temporary market dip and erode investor confidence before being exposed. This incident will highlight the growing need for robust identity verification solutions to ensure the authenticity of information and maintain trust in an increasingly digital world,” he said. 
  * “This incident will serve as a catalyst, accelerating the adoption of advanced identity verification solutions in the financial industry.”


**Typeform CPO Aleks Bass said that people will** “get scammed at a higher rate than what we are seeing now. 
“We might start asking ourselves, **‘is AI really worth it?’** We will see more companies investing money and time into locking down experiences and adding additional security, validation and verifications to prevent some of these abuses. But the challenge will be to create nearly invisible solutions, so as not to interrupt the customer experience.”

**A look back at related stories we’ve done in the past year:**
  * [Amazon pulls AI-generated books after Deep View inquiry](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/amazon-pulls-ai-generated-books-after-deep-view-inquiry>)
  * [US hospital gets an AI assistant](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/us-hospital-teams-suki-ai-assistant>)

  * [Meta and Big Tech’s nuclear revolution](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/meta-and-big-tech-s-nuclear-revolution>)


**Cybersecurity firm Exabeam expects,** similar to much of what we’ve already discussed, highly enhanced and empowered cybercriminals, leading to new types of attacks and increasing exploitation. 
**Steve Povolny, one of Exabeam’s co-founder** s, said that, in 2025, “AI will democratize malware creation.”
  * “You won’t need to be a coder to create sophisticated malware in 2025 — AI will do it for you. Generative AI models trained specifically to generate malicious code will emerge in underground markets, making it possible for anyone with access to deploy ransomware, spyware and other types of malware with little effort,” he said. 
  * “Blindly trusting AI-generated outputs will become a major vulnerability for organizations. This will lead to the rise of a new cybersecurity mandate: **‘Zero Trust for AI.** ’ Unlike traditional Zero Trust principles, Zero Trust for AI is not a prediction for the future; it’s a concept ready for discussion now, bringing a nuanced approach to trusting AI. This framework will require organizations to verify, validate and fact-check AI outputs before allowing them to drive critical security decisions.”


Povolny thinks that video-based deepfakes will soon become “imperceptible from reality,” unleashing a “devastating new wave of social engineering attacks” that will allow “criminals to impersonate executives, forge high-stakes transactions, and extract massive payouts from unsuspecting victims. With AI making deepfakes accessible at the push of a button, the potential for financial fraud will explode, forcing organizations to rethink how they verify identity in an increasingly deceptive world.”
**Harry Muncey, Senior Director of Data Science** , and Responsible AI at Elsevier, expects the adoption of generative AI to continue, leading to improved confidence in “low-risk use cases” that “will lead to pressure for innovation and use in higher-risk environments, such as healthcare, where the need for robust guardrails is clearly critical.”
**And Vijay Balasubramaniyan** , the co-founder of CEO of Pindrop, expects deepfake attacks to “accelerate at an alarming rate” next year.

I wholeheartedly expect — and I really hope I am wrong — that the ethical challenges related to artificial intelligence will become much more significant throughout 2025 as adoption continues, legislation lags and systems become more capable. 
A year ago, I saw no clear solution to the problem of deepfake abuse and harassment; I think we have made no progress on that front whatsoever. Instances will continue to occur at small and large scales. People will get hurt. And while I do worry about misinformation and its spread online, I am far more concerned about schools and this new, dangerous form of bullying and harassment that, without governance, oversight and regulation, will continue unabated. 
I also expect addictions to and obsessions with anthropomorphized GenAI chatbots to steadily spike as vulnerable people interact with these systems, leading to a heavy, noticeable increase in digital isolation, something that may start to become more clearly associated with mental health struggles. 
I expect we will additionally begin to see the problems of overreliance, specifically in high-risk environments. Hospitals, I think, will run into at least a few well-publicized instances regarding generative AI misuse.
As with any problem, things have to get worse before they get better — I think 2025 will be the year that these issues move off the fringe to become more mainstream; only then might action be taken against them. I do not expect that action to come soon, however. 
On the copyright front, I think we’ll see some significant movement from the big copyright infringement cases this year (Authors Guild and New York Times) that may — and that’s a very big ‘may’ — have implications for the future development of foundation models. I don’t expect mass job loss anytime soon — or at all, really — but I do think we’ll start to see a reduction in hiring due to internal reliance on AI tools. 
On the environmental front, the optimist in me hopes that the sheer cost of data center operation will drive massive innovations in energy efficiency, which will have positive impacts on sustainability. This, however, might very well be wishful thinking; the complexity and use of generative AI systems continues to grow, meaning energy efficiencies will simply free developers up to handle bigger workloads, rather than reducing their energy use. 
My areas of biggest concern involve algorithmic surveillance and discrimination, unsustainability, deepfake abuse and artificial companionship; as these issues continue to worsen — I expect them all to become hallmarks of this next year — global society will be pushed to the edge of truly radical transformation.

**Good morning.** Over the past two months or so, I’ve been collecting predictions from people across the AI industry about what 2025 might look like. 
So, over the next week, we’ll be taking a bit of a departure from the AI news of the day to instead take a deep look, both into 2025 (_and back at 2024_) in a progress and predictions series that aims to examine how far AI has come, and where it might be headed. Had a lot of fun putting this together. 
We’re kicking things off today with a look into one aspect of technical progress, crossed with the question of enterprise adoption. The consensus here is that 2025 will become known as the ‘year of the AI agent.’

# **But first … A look back at 2024 and the rise of the AI chatbot**

Before we get to the agents and what might lie ahead, we have to start with chatbots, and the language models they’re built on. 
**The rise of generative AI** : In the beginning, there was nothing. Then, there was ChatGPT. Ok, well, that’s not strictly true, but the launch of ChatGPT — a generative interface built on a Large Language Model (LLM) — is regarded as the moment that sparked the current AI boom. 
Importantly, it made AI technology — which, beforehand, was an under-the-hood kind of technology — visible. People could interact with it. And that’s what changed everything. That moment came at the tail end of 2022, making 2023 the year of the chatbot race and 2024 the year of the chatbot (_OpenAI chief Sam Altman said in December that ChatGPT had reached 300 million weekly active users_). 
  * ChatGPT touched off a race for bigger and better generative AI chatbots, and the market was anxious to compete. Anthropic’s Claude models followed, as did Google’s Gemini models, Meta’s Llama models, Mistral’s models and a whole slew of startups building generative AI assistants, either from scratch, or on ChatGPT itself. 
  * 2024, in many ways, was the year of generative AI chatbot integration. Developers worked hard to sell iterations of the tech to everyone within reach, resulting in adoption at hospitals, accounting firms and many, many corporations. 


Corporate spending on generative AI, [according to a report last year,](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/business-spending-on-ai-jumps-500-to-13-8-billion-on-200-billion-in-capex>) spiked from $2.3 billion in 2023 to **$13.8 billion in 2024, a 500% increase**. The top five use cases here involved code generation, support chatbots, enterprise search and retrieval, data extraction and summarization and meeting summarization. 
Even as the bulk of AI projects in the enterprise remained unable to get off the ground, last year was a year of serious contemplation for corporations about the opportunities afforded them by generative AI. [As Microsoft told me](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/interview-microsoft-vp-on-agentic-push-and-ignite>), the experimentation phase has largely concluded; now, people are working on the application phase. 
And that leads us to agents.

# The agents are coming
As the tech becomes more integrated and normalized, expectations around application have shifted; chatbots are cool, but developers — particularly in enterprise offerings — have become increasingly interested in the evolution of the chatbot, which is something the industry has dubbed the “AI Agent.” 
[Microsoft, Google](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/report-europeans-would-let-an-ai-vote-for-them#2>) and [Nvidia have all begun](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/nvidia-s-push-for-ai-agents>) positioning and pushing so-called agentic offerings. 
The idea here is simple in concept; where a chatbot produces output in the form of imagery, textual or video content, an AI agent — built, of course, on the same LLM-based architecture — would complete actions. [Though each company has a different definition](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/nvidia-s-push-for-ai-agents>) of an agent, according to IBM, the term “refers to a system or program that is capable of autonomously performing tasks on behalf of a user or another system by designing its workflow and utilizing available tools.”
Deloitte [expects](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.deloitte.com/global/en/about/press-room/deloitte-globals-2025-predictions-report.html?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-the-year-of-the-ai-agent>) that 25% of the enterprises currently using generative AI will deploy AI agents next year, a number that will rise to 50% by 2027. Deloitte expects the capabilities of these systems to vastly improve throughout next year, a boon to their adoption and deployment. 
It is worth noting that issues of bias and hallucination in LLMs — in addition to their massive energy footprint — have not been solved; action-taking generative AI therefore poses risks of, not mistaken content, but mistaken actions, which would presumably have much more significant consequences. 
Still, industry experts that I spoke with think that 2025 will see the rise of so-called agentic software. 
[Dr. John Licato](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/cse.usf.edu/~licato/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-the-year-of-the-ai-agent>)**, an associate professor of computer science** at the University of South Florida and the founder/director of its Advancing Machine and Human Reasoning lab, told me that the biggest development in LLMs thus far involves the growth of agents. 
  * He said that this push toward no-code agentic AI will bring an influx of a greater variety of users, users who don’t necessarily know much at all about how generative AI, agents or LLMs work: “in 2025, those people are going to start realizing as they put these agents to work the kinds of mistakes they make. They’re either going to abandon it, or they’re going to say ‘i need something more serious here,’” Licato said. 
  * “People are actually gonna start seriously trying to look for, not just guardrails, but ways to check that their agents are actually going to do what they ask them to,” he said. 


[Dr. John Bates](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.comparethecloud.net/author/john_bates/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-the-year-of-the-ai-agent>)**, a former professor** who is now the CEO of SER, told me that, with the “information tsunami” expected to get worse and worse, agentic AI might offer a solution. 
  * “We’re not just drowning in unstructured and 'dark' data; we’re overwhelmed by structured data as well. That’s why I recommend keeping a close eye on Agentic AI, a pivot many vendors are looking to make. There’s certainly a role for agents that continuously analyze your documents, compare them with incoming information, and seek out valuable insights — essentially becoming intelligent curators of your digital landscape,” Bates said. 
  * “I envision two tiers of agents emerging: everyday assistants that help manage daily tasks and more advanced AIs that provide high-level analysis for making informed, rapid business decisions. In all honesty, we’ll need both types.I anticipate that 2025 will be a significant year for this evolution.”


**Uzi Dvir, CIO at WalkMe,** said that, as we get into 2025, the “agent wars are heating up.” 
  * “If 2024 was all about chatbots, 2025 is all about the agents. As the battle to make AI more useful and provide true ROI intensifies, the agent wars are heating up. While the first iteration of copilots augmented human tasks, this next generation is poised to fundamentally change how businesses operate. We’re already seeing the first wave of innovation as the big players jockey for position.”
  * “AI agents will bring new questions about automation and the role humans play. The path to victory doesn’t lie in these technology advancements alone, companies that actively start addressing change management alongside AI and copilots will reap the true rewards of all the intensifying innovation and competition.”


**A look back at related stories we’ve done in the past year:**
  * [Interview: Microsoft VP on agentic push and Ignite](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/interview-microsoft-vp-on-agentic-push-and-ignite>)

  * [Business spending on AI jumps 500% to $13.8 billion ... on $200 billion in capex](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/business-spending-on-ai-jumps-500-to-13-8-billion-on-200-billion-in-capex>)


**It’s an impression shared by Hyperscience CEO** Andrew Joiner, who said that the idea of human-in-the-loop technology will begin changing next year. 
  * “In 2025 and beyond, powerful AI models will oversee supervision activity that is performed by humans today, eventually moving toward fully autonomous systems. The prevalence of more autonomous systems will allow organizations to reallocate their people’s time to more strategic and creative pursuits within the organization.”
  * “We’ll move from ‘human in the loop’ toward ‘AI in the loop’ as models become more knowledgeable on specific business’ data.”


This push toward a more autonomous environment is one that many expect will translate to enterprise adoption, under the expectation that it will enable clearer and more actionable return on the massive investment of AI. 
**Hyperscience’s CTO Brian Weiss expects that** , next year, generative AI will no longer be a solution in search of a problem, something [we’ve talked about several times](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/interview-incorporating-generative-ai-start-problem>) in the past year — researcher and software engineer Molly White [noted last year](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/interview-incorporating-generative-ai-start-problem>) that Large Language Models (LLMs) _“do a poor job of much of what people try to do with them, they can't do the things their creators claim they one day might and many of the things they are well suited to do may not be altogether that beneficial.”_
Weiss said that the adoption approach toward generative AI has thus far gone backwards, with industries exploring with the tech by playing with its capabilities first, rather than identifying solutions to specific problems. This, he said, will change in 2025. 
  * “In 2025, the next frontier of generative AI will be leveraging the technology to truly derive valuable insights by identifying problems for solutions to address rather than simply generating content.”
  * “In the enterprise setting, we will see organizations moving to small language models (SLM) solutions in private cloud settings, where they can input their organizational data to build tailor-made solutions that understand the language of their business without fear of private business data being swept up in public-facing LLMs.”


**But Galileo co-founder Yash Sheth** told me that, while integration will continue ramping up in the enterprise, the process won’t be a smooth one, and it won’t be one-size-fits-all. 
“The industry has been led to believe that implementing AI into the enterprise is extremely easy,” he said. “In 2025, we’ll see the realization that there isn’t an ‘easy button’ and an evolution beyond simple interfaces (ChatGPT chatbot → RAG + Fine-Tuning) and into sophisticated implementations.” 
Still, Sheth said that the “world is moving towards just extracting more ROI from generative AI.”
The “whole trend towards agents is nothing but to get more ROI from generative AI systems. **Automation is the end goal.** You need to automate a lot of things using AI, where humans are involved and without true actions being taken by AI, it's not going to be full automation. Agentic systems are going to actually lead us to that automation and that ROI that we expect from generative AI.” 
As a result of this ever-increasing automation, computer scientist and AI expert Dr. Srinivas Mukkamala expects that it will start to become “radically difficult” for high-paying software developers to find a job in 2025 and beyond.

Get ready for my own predictions … 
In this conversation about the move to agentic AI and a more widespread integration of the tech by enterprises, I expect the road to perhaps be a little less rosy than it’s been thus far. Enterprises have had two years now to mess around with generative AI. And they’ve seen that hallucinations and algorithmic bias are a real problem, neither of which are going to go away. 
They’ve also been faced directly with the massive price tags associated with this tech, price tags that would be justifiable if things, well, worked — as we wrote about last year, some customers have [grown so frustrated with the usability and cost of Microsoft’s flagship Copilot](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/interview-microsoft-vp-on-agentic-push-and-ignite>) product that they have paused their subscriptions to it. 
So I would imagine that, as opposed to 2023, when every executive on the planet was anxious to say the word “AI” to appear with the times, we’ll see more caution in 2025. I think businesses are aware that there are gains to be made with AI, but maybe in less obvious ways — perhaps an email assistant isn’t worth the hassle and the cost, but maybe agentic AI solutions to track and cut down on energy usage could result in cost-savings that make an AI investment more than worthwhile. 
As part of that, I do think we will start to see a push away from single models and chatbots; **chatbots aren’t enormous time-savers for most people**. This is what’s behind the push for agents. And so, because of this, I do think we’ll see attempts at agents. I think this push is premature, however, and will result in a few enormously costly hallucinations that will make businesses think twice about deploying agentic solutions. 
On the model front, there’s been a gradual understanding that models are fine, but systems are far more useful. In the enterprise especially, looking at generative AI as a more holistic, more traditional digital system enables better cybersecurity protections as well as better results (think big models and small models integrated together in a stack). I expect we’ll start to see enterprises pushing in this direction (whether you want to call that an ‘agent’ depends on which company’s definition you choose to stand by). 
And, on the agentic front, again, I think the technology is premature for generative AI to jump into decision-making and action-taking, and I think it’ll result in costly errors that will spook customers (_just think of all the ways a hallucination could screw up buying airplane tickets without careful oversight_). I do, however, expect that all the major developers will launch clear iterations of their own versions of agentic AI — which will remain bounded and limited by the architecture; likely, these products will be more costly than current solutions, and we’ll just have to see if businesses will be interested in paying for that.
And that brings me to my final related point here — so far, the developers, through a combination of [venture capital dollars and Big Tech cash infusions](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/ai-companies-need-a-lot-of-money-investors-are-still-forking-it-over>) (**in the billions**) have been able to subsidize the cost of using generative AI as part of their desperate push to win users over to the tech. This will not continue in perpetuity. 
I fully expect that, in 2025, we will see major developers move from [talking about increasing subscription prices](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.theinformation.com/articles/openai-considers-higher-priced-subscriptions-to-its-chatbot-ai-preview-of-the-informations-ai-summit?rc=sbfmgm&utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-the-year-of-the-ai-agent>), to actually increasing baseline subscription prices, something that has already started to happen. OpenAI in December unveiled a $200/month Pro tier (though it did not axe its $20/month Plus tier). I would expect these significant price increases to become a norm across the industry; these businesses are burning cash at a rate that is difficult to comprehend, and with adoption set to hit higher levels in 2025, it seems like a good time to test the willingness of the market to cough up. (_OpenAI,_[_according_](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/x.com/sama/status/1876104315296968813?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=progress-predictions-2025-the-year-of-the-ai-agent>) _to Sam Altman, is losing money even on the $200/month tier; maybe things will go higher still_). 
I think this will push a large swath of people and smaller businesses away from the product. 
The last thing I’ll say here is that, enterprises aside, the push into agentic AI will usher forth a moment of reckoning for modern society; will ordinary people accept _and pay for_ the integration of systems that (unreliably, and at great cost) just do things for them? Or will they deem it ill-fitted to daily life? In this way, 2025 will be a telling year for the future, not just of AI, but of civilization. Will things be rejected? Will they be accepted with clear guardrails and limitations? Or will they be uncritically adopted? I can’t predict how this will play out, but it will be interesting to watch, with massive implications across a wide spectrum of ethical, economic and environmental issues.
