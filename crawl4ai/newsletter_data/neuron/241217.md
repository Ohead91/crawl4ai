## ChatGPT is basically becoming your new web browser… here are 3 reasons why.
**_Search—12 Days of OpenAI: Day 8_**
On Day 8 of [OpenAI’s 12 Days](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/openai.com/12-days/?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=f75fa65348483a3dde581ad24fa1262ff3134ed6>) holiday bonanza, the company announced [ChatGPT search](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/openai.com/index/introducing-chatgpt-search/?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=0671213f831b5da79d81b637146926d0680ca969>)—previously limited to paid users—is now available to all logged-in users globally _(and it's way better than before)._
This means all you need is a free ChatGPT account, and you can surf the web with it. _Cowabunga, dude!_
**This release also adds three key updates:**
  1. Voice-integrated search: chat with your phone instead of typing queries—[here’s a demo](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzgNJJ2ErEE&t=426s&utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=e2875b5373cb48a1d8ed4fc57b5a8be61b43dbd3>).
  2. Faster browser integration: set ChatGPT as your [default search engine](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzgNJJ2ErEE&t=258s&utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=e82bad83acaca5d690d6a9b6685a4308bf140087>) + get the direct links upfront.
  3. The ChatGPT mobile search experience gets some [updated features](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzgNJJ2ErEE&t=319s&utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=217833fd37a4475bbe9d052f2f51265bdb6da843>), too.


See, instead of typing keywords into a search bar, you can now just talk normally. ChatGPT figures out when to search, what to look for, and even adapts to your location. Need a restaurant with outdoor heating in SF? Just ask like you'd ask a local.
[![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6449a72526ec4987103ca41b/67614d0b95f8d3e05f67beae_Screenshot_2024-12-16_at_4.48.40_PM_1.png)](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/www.youtube.com/watch?v=OzgNJJ2ErEE&t=426s&utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=27e18ecb56cf6e3bf0fa8b5bfd0ef33d7753f796>)
_Quick side bar: when you talk to Advance Voice Mode, it still only shows the blue chat ball. This is bad UX design—because if you as the searcher want to reliably search with voice, you need to be able to SEE the results, so you can verify what the AI is saying is true. Hopefully they fix this ASAP. Audio + Visual search, in sync? That’s the future._
**Small changes? Maybe. But combined with this week's other releases, and you start to see OpenAI's bigger vision:**
[Projects](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/www.theneurondaily.com/p/sort-chatgpt-chats-in-2-mins?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=15abed7a8b3ed9c92ca26e92337752b8e5bc5d47>) transform how you organize information: Rather than juggling dozens of browser tabs, everything—searches, files, code, conversations—lives in one place.
And there’s [Canvas](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/www.theneurondaily.com/p/openai-fixed-their-ui?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=51d4b6ffbd06e2a6e7c9c3802beb68b2bd31f147>) and [video + screen share](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/www.theneurondaily.com/p/advanced-vision-mode?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=1c8536a83b8be667543bd7d1bf5d73b8207f0e28>):
  1. Want to build something? Create entire applications inside Canvas without switching tools.
  2. Need tech support? Instead of Googling forum posts and watching tutorials, just share your screen and get real-time guidance.


For better or worse, AI is about to become the _primary interfac_ e for how we interact with digital information and services. It’s like having a really smart Google Chrome that understands what you want, remembers your context, and can explain things simply.
**Think about it like this:** Browsers unified the web under the URL bar. ChatGPT is unifying the workspace (& maybe web??) under chat. But unlike browsers, which mainly handled text and images, ChatGPT seamlessly handles text, voice, video, code, and documents.
Chrome took 4 years to overtake Internet Explorer after launch. ChatGPT’s been around [for 2 years](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/www.nature.com/articles/d41586-024-03940-y?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=df3ed92912650661fecc5db90310d693a804a39f>)... _how long until it becomes your default interface for everything?_

When the Xbox first released, Halo defined a new generation of gaming and generated billions. Today, VR is viewed as gaming’s final frontier – poised for [837% growth](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/invest.aexlab.com/?utm_source=dmraexlablandingpage&utm_medium=partnership195-414_12-17&tnames=partnership195-414_12-17_17433329478&_bhlid=02b61e8926e6465dab23294d9769163df632476b>) – and with the success of VAIL VR, [AEXLAB](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/invest.aexlab.com/?utm_source=dmraexlablandingpage&utm_medium=partnership195-414_12-17&tnames=partnership195-414_12-17_17433329478&_bhlid=a8d99c831922ea9fe391921c0ac9158e487ca010>) is a proven winner.
More than 500,000 people have already played VAIL VR, good for a 4.8-star rating across 11,000+ reviews. And with [1,337% year-over-year growth](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/invest.aexlab.com/?utm_source=dmraexlablandingpage&utm_medium=partnership195-414_12-17&tnames=partnership195-414_12-17_17433329478&_bhlid=06516480ea14b7efb56930db3c0c10441af172e3>) in the game’s monthly active users, AEXLAB is building something special.

## Prompt Tip of the Day
We all know prompts are the secret sauce to getting what you want from AI, but with so many techniques floating around, it's easy to get lost. **Here's a quick cheat sheet to prompt like a pro**(inspired by [this Reddit post](https://www.theneuron.ai/newsletter/<https:/www.reddit.com/r/ChatGPTPromptGenius/comments/1hcsmem/30_chatgpt_prompt_techniques_in_30_seconds/?utm_source=www.theneurondaily.com&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=gpt-search-unlocked&_bhlid=075c2fea4f5775972f453e6c7066f9f6e5169ca7>))**:**
**3 Core Concepts:**
  * Be specific (vague prompts = vague answers).
  * Assign roles (want teacher-style explanations? Tell it to be a teacher).
  * Set clear limits (want 3 bullet points? Just say so).


**10 Open-Ended Prompts that work:**
  * "How can I..." (gets detailed steps).
  * "What are..." (gets lists and explanations).
  * "Describe..." (gets rich descriptions).
  * "Explain..." (gets teaching-style responses).
  * "In what ways..." (gets creative solutions).
  * "Tell me about..." (gets comprehensive overviews).
  * "What if..." (gets scenario analysis).
  * "Can you elaborate..." (gets deeper dives).
  * "What do you think..." (gets analytical responses).
  * "Why..." (gets reasoning and rationale).


1**0 Closed-Ended Prompts for specific answers:**
  * Yes/No questions.
  * Either/Or choices.
  * Multiple choice options.
  * Fact verification.
  * Confirmation checks.
  * Binary decisions.
  * Quantity checks.
  * Specific details.
  * Format preferences.
  * Status inquiries.


**7 Deep-Dive Prompts to go further:**
  * “Can you provide more details on...”
  * “You mentioned X, can you elaborate...”
  * “What exactly do you mean by...”
  * “What assumptions are we making about...”
  * “Why do you think...”
  * “What evidence supports...”
  * “How would [expert] view...”


**Pro tip:** Think of prompting like having a conversation with a very knowledgeable but quite literal friend. The clearer you are about what you want, the better the response you'll get.

  * S.V. chose **Can’t wait:** “I'm so excited at the prospect of videos becoming even more life-like. For me I'm interested in using it for my avatar and creating original scripts to go with it. Also want to create captivating videos that will cause a prospect to stop and want to watch it and know more afterwards. Lead generation basically.”
  * **P.W.** chose **Don’t need it:** “they took too long to release and other models are now eating their lunch.”
  * **W.L.** chose **Not interested:** “We all have had movie editing for years. I am not in the movie business. No need to do more than edit my family films together. Cut out the bad stuff. Put in cuts. Add music. I am not remotely interested in what AI can do for editing.”
