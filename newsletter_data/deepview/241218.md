# **AI for Good: Broken bones**

Britain‚Äôs National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in October [approved four AI tools to aid clinicians](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.nice.org.uk/news/articles/ai-technologies-recommended-for-use-in-detecting-fractures?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>) in the detection of broken bones on X-Rays.
**The details** : The recommendation allows [TechCare Alert](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.milvue.com/en/solutions/techcare-alert/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>), [BoneView](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.gleamer.ai/solutions/boneview?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>), [RBfracture](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.radiobotics.com/products/rbfracture?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>) or [Rayvolve](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.azmed.co/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation#home-product>) to be used in urgent care settings in the U.K. while evidence surrounding their performance is gathered in this real-world setting. 
  * Missed fractures reportedly occur in [3% to 10% of cases](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/pubs.rsna.org/doi/10.1148/radiol.211785?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori%3Arid%3Acrossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub++0pubmed&utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>); the evidence so far suggests, according to NICE, that the AI platforms approved above may improve fracture detection compared with a clinician reviewing an X-Ray on their own. 
  * The idea is that the systems employ AI to recognize and flag any potential anomalies, which are then reviewed by professionals; because this isn‚Äôt in any way replacing the clinicians, NICE said it‚Äôs a relatively low-risk application of AI. 


**Why it matters** : ‚ÄúUsing AI technology to help highly skilled professionals in urgent care centers to identify which of their patients has a fracture could potentially speed up diagnosis and reduce follow-up appointments needed because of a fracture missed during an initial assessment,‚Äù Mark Chapman, director of HealthTech at NICE, said.

# **Waymo goes international**

In the latest example of Waymo‚Äôs seemingly ceaseless expansion, the self-driving firm on Monday [said](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/waymo.com/blog/2024/12/partnering-with-nihon-kotsu-and-go-on-our-first-international-road-trip?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>) that it would soon start testing its autonomous vehicles in Tokyo, its first international expansion. 
**The details:** The first Waymos will arrive in Tokyo early next year; the first stage of their deployment will involve the manual mapping of key areas around the city, all done in partnership with drivers from local taxi company Nihon Kotsu. 
  * The data gathered from this manual mapping process will be used to train the AI systems that operate the vehicles. 
  * It‚Äôs not clear yet when Waymo will be fully open for service in Tokyo, or how much of the city will be accessible to the self-driving vehicles. The company told CNBC that this initial testing phase is expected to take several quarters.


**The landscape:** Japan, according to the [World Economic Forum](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.weforum.org/stories/2024/12/japan-senior-driver-safety/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>), is actively exploring safer driving solutions for its aging population. As part of this, it has been testing self-driving ventures. 
Several local companies ‚Äî [Tier IV](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/tier4.jp/en/about/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation#tier_iv_history>), [ZMP](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.zmp.co.jp/products/robocar-innovation?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>) and [Monet Technologies](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/02/11/tech/tokyo-robotaxi-service/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>) ‚Äî are building and actively testing self-driving cars. 
In the U.S., however, Waymo doesn‚Äôt really have much competition, especially given Cruise‚Äôs recent shutdown. As other firms have lagged behind or fallen off, Waymo has spent 2024 steadily expanding its areas of operation, recently announcing that it will soon begin testing in Miami, a significant step forward given the rainy weather conditions of the East Coast.

# **Report: AI Search gains aren‚Äôt enough to displace Google**
![](https://media.beehiiv.com/cdn-cgi/image/fit=scale-down,format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=80/uploads/asset/file/fa323de6-1323-420c-b2a0-9580168c5927/3.jpg?t=1734452647)

AI Search platforms ‚Äî led by Perplexity and OpenAI ‚Äî have become more popular of late. A new report from SEO firm BrightEdge found that the AI search entrants are ‚Äúgaining ground,‚Äù but displacing Google is likely not in the cards. 
**The details** : The report found that, in November, OpenAI‚Äôs search engine experienced a 44% month-over-month growth in referrals; Perplexity experienced a 71% growth. 
  * BrightEdge found that OpenAI search ‚Äî which launched as SearchGPT in August ‚Äî now has six times more search usage than Perplexity in terms of referral clicks.
  * ‚ÄúThis rapid ascent puts ChatGPT on a trajectory to potentially capture a 1% market share in 2025,‚Äù according to BrightEdge, something that could translate to $1.2 billion(+) in revenue. 


**But, Google:** At the same time, Google has been expanding its AI Overviews, which, according to the company, are now reaching more than a billion users each day. Google‚Äôs AI Overviews, according to BrightEdge, have become far more stable than they were at launch, and Google‚Äôs search market share remains at 92.4%, ‚Äúmeaning that new entrants **will need to coexist with and differentiate themselves from Google,** rather than aiming to overtake the search giant.‚Äù
"This is a moment of inevitability in search; we've long anticipated the rise of AI, and now it's reshaping the search landscape before our eyes," Jim Yu, CEO and co-founder of BrightEdge, said in a [statement](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2024/12/16/2997560/0/en/New-Report-from-BrightEdge-Reveals-Surge-in-AI-Search-Engines-Signaling-a-New-Era-in-Online-Information-Discovery.html?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>). "The data clearly shows that the stakes have never been higher. Newer entrants like ChatGPT search and Perplexity are gaining ground, while Google‚Äôs AI Overviews are getting smarter.‚Äù
It remains unclear just how much the introduction of AI to search increases the regular energy consumption and carbon emissions of search.

Note: the following was corrected on 12-19-2024 to address a typo 
The past couple of years have seen a massive expansion of AI accessibility, Douwe Kiela, CEO and co-founder of [enterprise AI startup Contextual AI](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/contextual-ai-building-the-next-generation-of-rag#true-price-of-ai>), told me. Large Language Models (LLMs) and generative AI have never been more accessible than they are today; people no longer need to train models ‚Äî or even understand a lick of code ‚Äî in order to deploy models, thanks to APIs. 
**The problem,** Kiela said, is that, even as models have become more accessible, methods of evaluating those models**have not.** Evaluation still requires a deep expertise in data science and machine learning **at a pretty granular level** , according to Kiela, who said that it remains a relatively involved ‚Äúmanual process‚Äù that many people**just don‚Äôt know how to do.**
  * ‚ÄúThis would be fine if AI wasn't really used anywhere,‚Äù he said, chuckling. ‚ÄúBut AI is used everywhere now. So it's becoming a huge problem, especially if you're in a regulated industry, or something like that, you have to actually think very deeply about what you're doing there ‚Ä¶ **the tools don't really exist for people to do that properly.‚Äù**
  * The ideal scenario, according to Kiela ‚Äî who was one of the co-authors of the original [RAG research paper](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/contextual-ai-building-the-next-generation-of-rag#true-price-of-ai>) ‚Äî would be to make LLM evaluation accessible to developers ‚Äúin the same way that you make language model APIs accessible.‚Äù 


Contextual AI on Tuesday introduced [LMUnit](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/contextual.ai/news/lmunit/?utm_source=thedeepview&utm_medium=newsletter&utm_campaign=interview-a-new-approach-to-ai-evaluation>), a system designed to do exactly that. 
**The details:** According to Contextual, LMUnit enables developers to define and evaluate natural language unit tests to get detailed, ‚Äúfine-grained‚Äù understandings of model performance, something that allows for **‚Äúprecise diagnosis‚Äù of potential problems.**
  * Current methods for LLM evaluation ‚Äî which involves the scoring of response content and quality ‚Äî involve human annotation, automatic metrics and language model judging, where a separate model evaluates a model‚Äôs performance. The problem with these methods, according to Contextual, is that they‚Äôre either too expensive, require too much expertise or are simply**not fine-grained enough to be of value**. 
  * Similar to unit testing for traditional software, LMUnit powers unit testing that evaluates ‚Äúdiscrete qualities of individual model outputs ‚Äî from basic accuracy and formatting to complex reasoning and domain-specific requirements. This enables developers to evaluate LLM responses granularly to learn **specific signals for improvement.‚Äù**


The tests can be constructed ‚Äî _in natural language_ ‚Äî manually or synthetically, and score each response with a ‚Äúpass‚Äù or ‚Äúfail.‚Äù 
**‚ÄúIt just needs to be its own category of models,‚Äù** Kiela said. ‚ÄúJust like we have an embedding model, which is different from a language model, because we need to take those embeddings and put them in our vector database ‚Ä¶ these are just separate models with different kinds of things they do. And so evaluation very clearly needs to be its own category.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt's not about models. It's about systems, and **the entire system is what solves your problem,** ‚Äù he added, saying that the language model component often only makes up around **‚Äú20% of that system.‚Äù**
LMUnit is now available both to the public through Contextual‚Äôs API, as well as to Contextual‚Äôs customers. 
Contextual closed an [$80 million funding round in August](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/contextual-ai-building-the-next-generation-of-rag#true-price-of-ai>). 
This comes amid both a broad push toward AI ‚Äúagents‚Äù ‚Äî which Kiela referred to as systems but with more hype ‚Äî and a steady increase in [enterprise AI adoption](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/business-spending-on-ai-jumps-500-to-13-8-billion-on-200-billion-in-capex>). As corporations commit to spending more and more money on AI products, many have become heavily focused on [ensuring that they are deriving clear returns](https://www.thedeepview.co/p/<https:/www.thedeepview.co/p/business-spending-on-ai-jumps-500-to-13-8-billion-on-200-billion-in-capex>) from their costly investments; unsolved reliability issues at the model level have paved the way for broader systems that allow companies to overcome those problems, which could enable broader deployment.

47% of you don‚Äôt use them today, but expect you will soon; 30%, meanwhile, don‚Äôt ever plan on putting on a pair of smart glasses. 
I‚Äôll mess around with them, but I don‚Äôt love the idea of putting technology on my face. I‚Äôll keep it in my hands, thanks.
### Do you use Google's AI Overviews or other AI search platforms?
